                        will select or suggest a suitable Space for a User. In doing so, spaces.one Representative will take into account User’s preferences and requirements. Consequently, a User may send you a Booking Enquiry or, if requested by User,
                        a spaces.one Representative can send you a Booking Enquiry on User’s behalf which you agree to receive.</p>
                    <p>3.5. You agree that you will respond to Booking Enquiries from Users or spaces.one Representatives either by replying to or rejecting Booking Enquiries. All Booking Enquiries will be visible and accessible to you when you log in to

                        must update the status of a relevant Booking Enquiry to “Booking confirmed” in your spaces.one account.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <li>4.9.2. A Booking was cancelled by a User according to the Section 6 of these Terms and a full refund is payable to a User.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>4.10. Where the Invoice Payment Method is enabled by a Space, the following terms shall apply:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4.10.1. spaces.one will invoice a Space Manager for a Booking or a Booking Enquiry with “Booking confirmed” status within 7 days after the date for which a Booking was made. We require a valid copy of a receipt, bill or invoice

                        <li>4.10.4. A failure to pay an invoice within 14 days of the due date may result in your account being suspended and your credit history being affected.</li>
                        <li>4.10.5. In the event we reasonably incur any costs such as tracing or debt collection agency costs or seek legal advice or take legal proceedings to enforce our rights as a result of your breach of these Terms, including but not
                            limited to recovery of any sums due, you will reimburse us such reasonable expenses, agency costs or legal costs incurred on an indemnity basis.</li>
                        <li>4.10.6. Without prejudice to Section 4.10.4, in the event of a late payment spaces.one may without notice exercise our rights under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 and charge interest at 8% above the Bank
                            of England base rate that is applicable to business to business transactions. In addition to interest on late payments, spaces.one reserves the right to claim debt recovery costs on late payments as specified in Section 5A

                    </ul>
                    <p>4.11. Your obligation to pay us the Commission will not be subject to a User making a payment to you for a given Booking made through our Platform.</p>
                    <p>4.12. For the avoidance of doubt, a Commission is due and payable in the following events of Booking cancellations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a) If a Booking was cancelled by a User, including an event described in Clause 6.9 of these Terms, and a User is not eligible for a refund;</li>
                        <li>b) If a Booking was cancelled by a User subject to Section 6 of these Terms and a partial refund is due to a User,</li>
                        <li>c) Where a non-refundable deposit was paid and a Space Manager retained it following a cancellation, that deposit is subject to a Commission and Clauses 4.4 and 4.5 will apply;</li>
                        <li>d) If a Booking was cancelled by a Space.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>4.13. All rights and obligations in respect of payment of any commission are binding on both you and ourselves as well as your and our assignees and successors.</p>
                    <p>4.14. Where the Online Payment Method is enabled, the following terms shall apply:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4.14.1. Payment Processing is currently provided by Stripe (<a href="http://www.stripe.com">www.stripe.com</a>) for credit and debit card payments to Space that opted-in to use Stripe Payment Processing services. Whenever a payment
                            is processed by Stripe, the terms and conditions of Stripe Services Agreement and Stripe Connected Account Agreement as well as other applicable Terms and Policies shall apply as may be amended by Stripe from time to time.
                            Your use of Payment Processing is subject to your compliance with all the applicable terms and conditions of Stripe and you will be required to set up a Stripe Connect Account and to complete a required verification process.</li>
                        <li>4.14.2. Use of Payment Processing and Online Payment Method requires a Space Manager to provide current, accurate and complete information about a Space and its business and you authorise spaces.one to share this data to the Payment
                            Processor. spaces.one does not collect, store or retain any bank account, debit or credit card or payment details. spaces.one shall not be responsible or liable for the acts of the Payment Processor. All personal information
                            provided to Stripe will be treated in accordance with the Stripe Privacy Policy, which you should read carefully. spaces.one does not control nor is responsible for how your personal information is treated by Stripe.</li>
                        <li>4.14.3. spaces.one shall cover the Stripe service fees (“Payment Processing Fees”). If, however, there are any other charges and fees that a Space is responsible for, you agree to indemnify spaces.one in full for these charges
                            and fees if such were paid by spaces.one.</li>
                        <li>4.14.4. Each Member appoints spaces.one to act as their limited payment collection agent solely for the limited purpose of collecting and processing the payment for the Booking. Without prejudice to the above in this clause, spaces.one
                            shall not assume responsibility for any acts of omissions of a Space.</li>
                        <li>4.14.5. Each Member acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding that spaces.one is not a party to the Agreement and does not act as an agent for any Member, we act as a Space’s payment collection agent for a sole limited purpose
                            of accepting payments from a User on behalf of a Space. Once a User makes a payment to spaces.one through the Payment Processor, a User’s payment obligation to a Space Manager for the agreed amount is deemed to be discharged
                            and spaces.one becomes the responsible party for transferring the funds to a Space Manager (referred to as “Payout” below) subject to the deduction of spaces.one Commission in accordance to these Terms and Space’s claim shall
                            only stand against spaces.one.
                        </li>
                        <li>4.14.6. You agree that payment made through Online Payment Method by a User shall be considered the same as payment made directly to you. A Space Manager will provide the services to a User as per the Agreement between Members
                            as if a Space Manager has received the payment directly from a User.</li>
                        <li>4.14.7. You agree that spaces.one may refund a User in accordance with these Terms and you acknowledge that our obligation to make a Payout of funds to you:
                            <ul>
                                <li>a) is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the relevant payment from a User as consideration for a given Agreement; and</li>
                                <li>b) shall only stand for the amounts that have been actually received by spaces.one from a User in accordance with these Terms.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>4.14.8. A User is charged once a Booking is confirmed and the funds in respect of that Agreement are deposited to the spaces.one Stripe Account where they are held on trust for and on behalf of the Space. spaces.one will use our
                            reasonable endeavours to initiate a Payout to a Space Manager within 3 to 7 working days after the Event end time subject to the agreed terms of the Booking and the service provided by the Space. spaces.one or a Payment Processor
                            on spaces.one’s behalf as the case may be shall deduct the spaces.one Commission from the total amount paid for the Booking before making a Payout of a balance to the Space.</li>
                        <li>4.14.9. If there are any additional charges for extending the length of the Booking or other charges associated with exceeding the agreed usage of the Booking by a User (“Additional Charges”), a Space Manager must report these
                            to spaces.one within 72 hours after the Booking end time. Once it is done, a User will have 48 hours to review and confirm Additional Charges through their spaces.one account. A Payout will then be initiated automatically to
                            your bank account. Depending on when Additional Charges were reported, a Payout may be made separately.</li>
                        <li>4.14.10. A Payout can be withheld if a dispute is initiated between a User and a Space Manager or otherwise permitted by these Terms. Payouts of Additional Charges for overtime or damages, or resulting from a dispute shall be paid
                            within a reasonable time after a dispute is settled. Timing of a payout may be changed if a Booking is updated, cancelled or rescheduled. The time it takes for a Payout to reach a Space’s account with the Payment Processor
                            is contingent on several factors:
                            <ul>
                                <li>a) a Space Manager providing accurate bank account details,</li>
                                <li>b) the banking provider used by the Space Manager and</li>
                                <li>c) User’s method of payment.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>4.14.11 Online Payment Method is mandatory:
                            <ul>
                                <li>a) for the Events in the categories “Production”, “Meetings” and “Dry Hire” as well as other categories that spaces.one may specify at its sole discretion; or</li>
                                <li>b) once you enable the Online Payment Method through your spaces.one Account.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>4.14.12 Without prejudice to Clause 4.14.11, processing a refundable security deposit is not currently supported through our Platform and it, therefore, is allowed to be done using another payment method of your preference communicated
                            to your User directly through spaces.one internal messenger. For the avoidance of doubt, all other payments must be still processed through the spaces.one Platform.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>4.15. As a part of our response to the adverse effects on the event industry in 2020, spaces.one had made a special offer to a selected and limited number of Space offering premises in the “Wedding” Events category and which were
                        not previously registered on our Platform (referred to as “Wedding Promotion Space” below):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4.15.1. For these Wedding Promotion Space staying on our Platform after 31 December 2021, spaces.one shall offer a reduced rate of 8% Commission on Bookings in the “Wedding” Events category to which a Space Manager also agrees
                            as a part of these Terms. For avoidance of doubt, the “Wedding” Events are identified as and labeled under the following keywords and tags on the spaces.one Platform: “Wedding”, “Asian Wedding”, “Outdoor Wedding”, “Unusual
                            Wedding”, “Wedding Ceremony”, “Wedding Reception”, “Civil Ceremony”, “Civil Partnership”, “Marquee Wedding”, “Unique Wedding”, “Garden Wedding”, “Gay Wedding”, “Dry Hire Wedding”. All other Event categories are subject to Commission
                            rate set out in Clause 4.1.</li>
                        <li>4.15.2. If a Space Manager of a Wedding Promotion Space decides to continue using our Platform after 31 December 2021, they shall agree to these Terms and Conditions in full as well as spaces.one Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy and
                            Superspace Terms and agree to enter into and comply with a legally binding contract with us on these Terms.</li>
                        <li>4.15.3. For the Wedding Promotion Space on our Platform after 31 December 2021, a Space Manager will gain access to the spaces.one Account and shall update information and Content in Space and Room Profiles in accordance with
                            Section 5 of these Terms.</li>
                        <li>4.15.4. If a Space Manager does not agree to these Terms, the Commission rate offered or other applicable Policies, their Space and Room profiles shall be suspended from our Platform.</li>

                                <li>b) 50% of a total amount paid to the Space Manager (excluding the Stripe service fees) will be refunded to a User if a cancellation is submitted less than 30 full days but at least 7 full days prior to the date of the Event;</li>
                                <li>c) No refund will be issued to a User if cancellation is submitted less than 7 full days prior to the date of the Event.</li>

                        <li>6.1.4. <strong>“Standard 60 Day”</strong> Booking cancellation policy means:
                            <ul>
                                <li>a) Full refund will be issued to a User if a cancellation is submitted at least 60 full days prior to the date of the Event;</li>
                                <li>b) 50% of a total amount paid to the Space Manager (excluding the Stripe service fees) will be refunded to a User if a cancellation is submitted less than 60 full days but at least 30 full days prior to the date of the
                                    Event;
                                </li>
                                <li>c) No refund will be issued to a User if cancellation is submitted less than 30 full days prior to the date of the Event.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>6.1.5. <strong>“Custom”</strong> Booking cancellation policy means that a Space Manager may set up its own cancellation policy and select an appropriate number of days and refund percentage value. This cancellation policy is not
                            available to Space that opted in to receive payments via Stripe.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>6.2. All cancellation periods are calculated based upon local time for the Space.</p>
                    <p>6.3. If a User has signed an agreement with a Space Manager for a Booking on customised terms and a User cancels that Booking, then in case of conflict the cancellation policy terms in that agreement will prevail.</p>
                    <p>6.4. For multi-day and nonconsecutive-day Events, the deadline for cancellation set forth in the applicable cancellation policy shall apply to Event start time for each day in which the Space is booked. Where a User cancels a portion
                        of a multi-day Booking, the fees and refunds will only apply to the specific dates cancelled.</p>
                    <p>6.5. For the purposes of this Section 6 of these Terms, a valid cancellation request shall constitute a User contacting a Space Manager through the spaces.one Platform as a follow-up message to the Booking Enquiry. A Booking is considered
                        to be cancelled once spaces.one sends a cancellation confirmation to the User if Online Payment Method is enabled or once a Space Manager sends a confirmation to the User if the Invoice Payment Method is enabled.</p>
                    <p>6.6. If a Space Manager having the Online Payments Method enabled for his Space and/or Rooms has received a cancellation request from a User and a full or partial refund is due to a User, that Space Manager must contact spaces.one
                        providing the Booking and its cancellation details. The refunds to Users from that point shall be handled by spaces.one according to the Space’s cancellation policy selected at the time of the Booking.</p>
                    <p>6.7. Any taxes spaces.one collected in relation to those amounts that are to be refunded to the User shall also be refunded and the non-refundable part of cancelled Booking shall remain taxable.</p>
                    <p>6.8. If a Space Manager changes its Booking cancellation policy, it shall not have a retrospective effect on any of its past Bookings. Each Booking will be cancelled according to the Booking cancellation policy selected by the Space
                        Manager at the time that Booking was made.</p>
                    <p>6.9. Users who do not show up to the Event or fail to cancel a Booking will not be eligible to receive a refund.</p>
                    <p>6.10. For the avoidance of doubt, when no refund is payable to the User following a cancellation, including the event described in Clause 6.9, a Commission to spaces.one is still payable according to the terms set out in Section 4.</p>
                    <p>6.11. All Bookings are subject to a grace period of 24 hours after a Booking confirmation was received, provided that a cancellation is made at least 48 hours prior to the date and time of the Event.</p>
                    <p>6.12. If a Space Manager cancels a confirmed Booking for any reason, spaces.one reserves a right in our sole discretion, to fully refund the User and suspend the Space's Account on the spaces.one platform disabling an option for it
                        to receive any new Booking Enquiries.</p>
                    <p>6.13. Without prejudice to the Clause 6.12, a Space Manager that has been awarded a “Super Space” status and badge according to the Super Space Terms, shall have its status suspended for 30 days after a Confirmed Booking was cancelled
                        by that Space.</p>
                    <p>6.14. Space may allow Users to reschedule a Booking for free and postpone the Event for up to 12 months period provided:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a) A duration of a rescheduled Booking has no material difference to the duration of the original Booking, pursuant to an approval from Space; and</li>
                        <li>b) Any rescheduled Booking must be confirmed between the parties prior to the date and time of the original Event.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In which case this will not be considered as a cancellation and any deposit or prepayment shall not be affected and shall be applied towards a rescheduled Event.</p>
